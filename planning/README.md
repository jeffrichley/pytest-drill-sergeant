## Key Concepts

### Behavior Integrity Score (BIS)
A per-test quality metric (0-100) that measures how well a test focuses on **WHAT** the code does rather than **HOW** it works internally.

### Battlefield Readiness Score (BRS)
An overall test suite quality metric (0-100) that combines multiple quality dimensions including AAA compliance, duplicate management, and fixture reuse.

### Personas
Configurable feedback personalities that make quality enforcement engaging and memorable, including Drill Sergeant Hartman, Snoop Dogg, and Motivational Coach.

### Analysis Pipeline
A modular system for detecting test quality issues through static AST analysis and dynamic runtime monitoring.

## Getting Started

1. **Review the Planning**: Start with the project overview and architecture documents
2. **Understand the Algorithms**: Study the analysis algorithms and scoring systems
3. **Follow the Phases**: Use the implementation phases as a development guide
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Follow the testing strategy for quality assurance
5. **Deploy Carefully**: Use the deployment guide for distribution
