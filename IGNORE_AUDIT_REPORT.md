## Configuration File Ignores

### `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- **MyPy hook commented out:** "skip for now due to pytest stubs"
  - **What's Hidden:** Type checking is disabled in CI
  - **Impact:** High - No type checking in automated pipeline
  - **Recommendation:** Re-enable with proper pytest stubs

### `pyproject.toml` - Ruff Configuration
**Total Ignores: 13 rules**

- **Legitimate ignores:**
  - `E501` - Line length (handled by Black)
  - `RUF001` - Emoji characters (intentional)

- **Temporary ignores (should be addressed):**
  - `TC001` - Type-checking imports
  - `BLE001` - Blind exception handling
  - `T201` - Print statements
  - `SLF001` - Private member access
  - `PT018` - Assertion breakdown
  - `PT013` - Pytest import style
  - `PTH123` - Pathlib usage
  - `ERA001` - Commented code
  - `TRY300` - Try/except patterns

## Risk Assessment

### ðŸ”´ **High Risk (Immediate Action Required)**
1. **Configuration parsing without type safety** - Could cause silent failures
2. **Plugin system without proper validation** - Runtime errors in plugin loading
3. **SARIF formatter using untyped library** - Report generation could fail

### ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Risk (Plan for Next Sprint)**
1. **Dynamic plugin class creation** - Custom plugins could fail
2. **CLI argument parsing type issues** - Configuration errors

### ðŸŸ¢ **Low Risk (Technical Debt)**
1. **Function parameter count** - Code maintainability
2. **Disabled type checking in CI** - Technical debt

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Sprint)
1. **Fix configuration parsing** - Add proper type guards and validation
2. **Add plugin validation** - Ensure plugin classes are properly typed
3. **Re-enable MyPy in CI** - Add proper pytest stubs

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
1. **Replace sarif_om with typed alternative** - Or add proper type stubs
2. **Refactor CLI argument parsing** - Use proper type conversion
3. **Address temporary Ruff ignores** - Fix the underlying issues

### Long Term (Technical Debt)
1. **Reduce function complexity** - Break down large functions
2. **Improve type coverage** - Aim for 100% type coverage
3. **Add runtime type validation** - For critical paths

## Conclusion

The ignore patterns reveal a codebase with **legitimate external boundary issues** but also **significant type safety gaps** in core functionality. The most critical issues are in the configuration and plugin systems, which could lead to runtime failures. Immediate attention should be given to fixing the type safety issues in these areas.

**Overall Assessment:** The slacker coder was hiding **real type safety issues** behind ignores rather than fixing the underlying problems. While some ignores are legitimate (external boundaries), the majority represent technical debt that should be addressed.
